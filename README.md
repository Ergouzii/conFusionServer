# Con Fusion Server

This is the backend server for a restaurant named _Con Fusion_,
a practice project to learn JavaScript backend development.

It is written using
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as runtime,
[Express.js](https://expressjs.com) as application framework.
The project structure is generated by
[Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)
It uses [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) as the persistent data store,
and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) ODM (object-document mapper).

### Authentication

It uses simple JWT-based authentications, and APIs are as following:

Operation | Method | URL | Body
--- | --- | --- | ---
Signup | POST | /users/signup | `{ "username": "abc", "password": "xyz" }`
Login | POST | /users/login | `{ "username": "abc", "password": "xyz" }`
Logout (_not used_) | GET | /users/logout |

When you login, you'll receive a _`token`_ in the response body.
Put that token in the request header as `Authentication: Bearer <token>` to
access restricted endpoints. The default expiration time of the tokens in 1 hour.
You'll have to relogin and obtain new token when the current token expires.
